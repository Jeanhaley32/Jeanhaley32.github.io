 personally hosted website


## About:
I was hosting this myself via a little golang http server I hacked up, that server should be on my github.
Once I was able to get it working with https etc, I move my site hosting to Github, it's much simpler and is way better written than anything
I'm going to be hacking up anytime soon. So, that is what this is.
